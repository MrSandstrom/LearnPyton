The student class

Now that we have covered the basics in python I want you to make a simple program. 
The program is a simple console program that takes input from the user and executes depending on what choice the user selects.

I want you to make a class called Student. 
The student class must have two properties/variables, first name and last name. 
Theese variables must be able to be changed upon the users input through functions. 
You must also be able to fetch the name of the student.

The second part of this assignment is to create a system that can take input from the user via the terminal. 
The system should not be a part of the student class. The program should only exit when the user wants it to exit.
The third part of this assigmnet is to expand the system to be able to add, remove and edit the students. 

 

Example of the user interface:

--- Select input ---

1. Add Student.

2. View Students.

3. Edit Student.

4. Quit.

 

--- Select input ---

1. View name.

2. Change name.

3. Remove Student.

4. Quit.

 

Hints:

Use a while loop for the program flow. 
Use try except for handling input or casting errors. 
First make the system so it can handle a single student. 
When everything works, expand it so it can handle multiple students. 
Use a list or a dictionary to store the students.
